## 🧪 Testing Activities

### 1. Static Testing
- Static code analysis using **SpotBugs / SonarQube**
- Code inspection and documentation of findings
- Systematic GitHub usage with regular commits from each team member

### 2. Testing Analysis
Each team member performed **three testing analyses on distinct methods**, documented individually in the project documentation:
- **Boundary Value Analysis**
- **Equivalence Class Analysis** 
- **Code Coverage Analysis**:
  

### 3. Dynamic Testing
- **Unit Testing** using JUnit  
- **Integration Testing** between system components  
- **System & UI Testing** using TestFX  

##  Reports
The **REPORTS** folder contains **individual PDF reports for each team member**, describing assigned responsibilities, analyses, and test results.
